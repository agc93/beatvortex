[{"body":"BeatVortex is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for installing and managing Beat Saber mods in Vortex, just like any other supported title. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods, Beat Games or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.\nStatus and Limitations BeatVortex is still beta-quality software! While I can test locally, I won’t be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven’t been found yet. The following is definitely supported at this point:\n Installing mods: Installing mods or maps from archive files works, deploying directly to your install directory. Managing mods: The standard Vortex install/enable/disable/uninstall operations should all work just as they do for any other Vortex-managed game. Finding new mods: Most mods can be browsed directly using the built-in BeatMods browser. Using the “Get more mods” menu in Vortex to download mods should automatically install them with Vortex. Profiles: Create multiple profiles for different sets of mods or songs and quickly switch between them. OneClick installs: There is preview support for OneClick installs from BeatSaver and ModelSaber allowing you to install and manage songs easier than ever. Dependencies: Vortex’s support for dependencies is….complicated but as of Alpha 3, BeatVortex will warn you about missing dependencies, and attempt to automatically install them. Updates: Vortex’s native update check will now check for and install updates for any of your mods from BeatMods  There’s some features that we’ve included to get them in your hands as fast as possible, but might still have some rough edges:\n Playlists: BeatVortex natively supports installing and managing playlists, and there is also a playlists manager in Vortex that you can enable Sync: A lightweight alternative to BeatSyncConsole, this preview feature can sync and install your bookmarked maps from BeastSaber  Finally, there’s a few things that anyone used to other tools might miss though, as we haven’t implemented them yet:\n Previews/metadata: Vortex regards songs as just another type of mod, so you won’t get the level of details, stats or previews that something like BeatDrop gives you. Error Handling: BeatVortex’s error handling is pretty barebones. You might see more errors and odd behaviours during installs.   If you’re really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the BSMG Discord.\n Nexus Mods To be clear and upfront: being supported in Vortex (using BeatVortex) does not mean that mods or songs will be available on Nexus Mods, nor does Nexus Mods officially support Beat Saber. BeatVortex itself includes support for BeatMods and BeatSaver/BeastSaber, but Nexus does not host Beat Saber mods. See the FAQ for extra details.\n","categories":"","description":"A basic introduction to BeatVortex\n","excerpt":"A basic introduction to BeatVortex\n","ref":"/docs/introduction/","tags":"","title":"Introduction"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/releases/","tags":"","title":"Releases"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with BeatVortex and managing Beat Saber mods with Vortex.

You don’t! If you prefer using any of the other community-provided mod tools (like Mod Assistant), I recommend using them! In fact, Mod Assistant provides a few features that BeatVortex/Vortex (or Nexus Mods) simply doesn’t support, and the two tools work in fundamentally different ways.\nBeatVortex is just an alternate method of installing mods for those who are more familiar with Vortex already.\nWhy not just use Mod Assistant? See above ⬆. Use what you prefer! Prefer the familiarity of Vortex? Use BeatVortex. Prefer the extra features of Mod Assistant? Use that. Got your own set of tools? Use those.\nIn fact, generally speaking, you should be able to use BeatVortex alongside those other tools without any major problems.\nI’m a mod/pack author, how do I make mods compatible with Vortex? They probably already are! If you want to maximise support and avoid some issues, pack your mod archive in such a way that the root of the archive should end up at the root of the install directory (for mods, not maps), and that’s basically it. There’s a little more detail in the developer docs as well.\n A special note for BeatSaver maps: if users download a map from BeatSaver and install it with BeatVortex, it will actually hit BeatSaver’s API to get the proper name to keep those mod lists neat. The directory in the install folder will have a terrible name, though.\n Why can’t I download mods from the Nexus? Nexus Mods doesn’t support Beat Saber mods (and most likely never will), so you will not be able to download mods from the Nexus website. You can, however, download from BeatMods or BeatSaver and install in Vortex.\nWhat’s the deal with game versions? Why do I have to choose my version? Now that’s a saga of a question. There’s two reasons we have to do this: compatibility and BeatMods being BeatMods.\nThe first (and major) point is that BeatVortex can’t tell which versions are forward compatible. That is, we know that mods for 1.8.0 work in 1.9.0, but BeatVortex doesn’t have any easy way to tell that. So if there’s not an exact match to your installed version, we ask you to choose.\nThe other (unfixable from our end) problem is that the BeatMods API has a very weird bug/behaviour that means we somehow have to know what game version the mod uses in order to find out what game version the mod uses. This is also why we don’t display what game version an installed mod uses: the BeatMods API tells us the completely wrong version.\nNone of my mods are installed suddenly? Where did they go? This can happen for a few reasons, most commonly an update for Beat Saber or if you verify/reinstall/move the game in Steam. First, run Beat Saber at least once. After any update, you need to run Beat Saber at least once to update a few important files.\nNext, purge your mods using the Purge button in the Mods list. Once that’s complete, make sure the right mods are installed, enabled and up-to-date, and click Deploy Mods. Vortex will redeploy your enabled mods into your game’s install directory.\nAre mod dependencies supported/installed? Dependencies is a tricky area for a few reasons, and driven by two different problems: Vortex support and the BeatMods API.\n If you want the full technical breakdown, check out the full developer docs on dependencies.\n As of v0.3.1, dependencies support is available and enabled by default: dependencies are shown in the Mods list and BeatMods browser, and we will attempt to automatically download and install them when you install any mod from BeatMods. However, this hasn’t been fully tested and might still have some quirks or errors.\nAre mod updates supported? As of v0.4.0, mod updates are supported and enabled by default: check your mods for updates like you would any other Vortex-managed game and BeatVortex will automatically check BeatMods for any available updates! Check the usage docs for more information.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can …","ref":"/docs/introduction/faq/","tags":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"body":"Installing BeatVortex There’s a couple of different ways to install BeatVortex! Unless you’ve got a pretty specific use case, you’ll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.\nAutomatic Installation  This is the easiest way to install!\n  Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find Beat Saber Support and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Beat Saber in your Games screen and you’re ready to install some mods!\nSemi-Automatic Installation If you can’t install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.\n Download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub Open the Extensions panel in Vortex Click on the Drop File(s) box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded. Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Beat Saber in your Games screen and you’re ready to install some mods!\nManual Installation  Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.\n If you want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the actual extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.\nFirst, download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub.\nNext, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named game-beatsaber with four files inside:\n info.json index.js gameart.png beatModsList.scss  Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: %APPDATA%/Vortex and then opening the plugins directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).\nOnce you’re done, you should have four files at the following locations:\nC:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-beatsaber\\info.json C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-beatsaber\\index.js C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-beatsaber\\gameart.png C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-beatsaber\\beatModsList.scss With those files in place, you’re clear to start Vortex and you should see the Beat Saber icon in the Games screen light up.\n","categories":"","description":"Installing the BeatVortex extension into Vortex\n","excerpt":"Installing the BeatVortex extension into Vortex\n","ref":"/docs/usage/installation/","tags":"","title":"Installing BeatVortex"},{"body":" BeatVortex 0.2.1 (and later) includes beta support for prompting when an IPA patch is needed and automatically running it.\nIf you haven’t already run IPA for your current install, you should be prompted to run it after your first deploy.\n At it’s core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, just without the convenience of installing from Nexus Mods. Make sure you’ve added Beat Saber as a managed game in Vortex.\nIf you haven’t already, open the Games screen and click the Manage button on the Beat Saber icon under Unmanaged\n There’s a few main ways to install mods:\n OneClick installspreview BeatMods Browser Download in Vortex Install from archives  OneClick Installationpreview One-click installation of custom songs from BeastSaber, BeatSaver or ModelSaber requires first enabling it in your Vortex settings.\n Enabling one-click installs in Vortex will most likely prevent Mod Assistant from handling one-click installs!\n From the Settings screen, open the Download tab and scroll down to the “Enable OneClick Installations” section. Check the boxes to enable OneClick installations for maps or custom models (or both!). You can also toggle these back off to “unregister” Vortex for handling these links.\n You should see this change immediately, but if you’re having problems, try restarting Vortex\n Open up BeatSaver/BeastSaber/ModelSaber and click any of the OneClick install links: Vortex should pick up the link in the background, fetch the song details and download the map (or mod) directly into your mod list. Install and Enable as per usual to deploy into your game.\nA note on ModelSaber installs Since ModelSaber models are not distributed as archives but just raw files, Vortex will warn you and will create a mod archive with just that one file. All of Vortex’s install and deployments logic really works best with archives.\nBeatMods Browser If you’re looking to install any of the mods listed on BeatMods, you can easily do so from the BeatMods page in the sidebar (available from v0.2.0 onwards). This will list all approved mods for your current game version and you can quickly install them using the Ready to Install button on the right.\nNote that since Vortex can’t tell which Beat Saber versions are mod-compatible (i.e. 1.8.0 mods work in 1.9.0), you may have to manually choose a version using the switcher at the top of the page to see all available mods.\n BeatVortex should automatically prompt you to install dependencies when you install BeatMods mods from the browser. You can also check the Dependencies column of the Mods list to see what your mods need.\n Download in Vortex Once you’ve added Beat Saber, you can jump over to the usual Mods screen using the menu on the left. You might not have any mods here, but if you click on the But don’t worry, I know a place… dropdown, you’ll get the choice of installing from BeatMods, BeatSaver or BeastSaber.\n This option will move to the Get more mods drop-down after you have installed your first mod.\n You can browse mods using the built-in browser that appears and if you download the ZIP archive of any song (from BeatSaver/BeastSaber), mod (from BeatMods), or model (from ModelSaber), Vortex will attempt to install it in the background for you. Close the browser to go back to your mod list then Install and Enable your mods as usual to use them in-game.\nInstall from archives You can also download mod/map archives directly from BeastSaber, BeatSaver, BeatMods, #pc-mods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the Install From File button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.\n Be aware that installing from archives will often not include the full metadata so mods may be confusingly named. Double-click the mod in the mod list to change its name.\n Please note that “raw” mods that aren’t packaged in an archive (for example, plain dll files provided by some GitHub projects or #pc-mods posts) will not work quite right. Just like ModelSaber models, when you install a loose dll file Vortex will prompt you to create an archive for just that file so you can still install and manage the mod like archives.\nUpdating Mods  This feature is available in v0.4.0 or later\n In the latest versions of BeatVortex, support for BeatMods updates is enabled by default. You can use the normal “Check for Updates” button in the Mods list to immediately check all your installed BeatMods mods for updates and optionally update them in one-click. This will also preserve the old version in your Mods list!\nMod updates are a new feature that have not necessarily been fully tested, so please report any bugs or issues you find.\nThat being said, BSIPA will also try and automatically keep your mods updated on launch by default. This will lead to the mods you see in-game not necessarily being the same version you deployed, and Vortex might prompt you about changes to the files when BSIPA updates them. Check the docs here for more info on that.\n","categories":"","description":"How to install, view and manage your mods in Vortex.\n","excerpt":"How to install, view and manage your mods in Vortex.\n","ref":"/docs/usage/mods/","tags":"","title":"Installing Mods"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with BeatVortex and managing Beat Saber mods with Vortex.

Just double-click on the name of any mod in your mod list and you’ll get a small dialog where you can change the name and author, or add some notes for yourself. It’s not recommended to change the source or mod type as these control how mods are handled internally.\nProfiles Just like any other Vortex game, you can have multiple profiles configured for different mod selections. Don’t want your streaming mods enabled when you’re offline? Set up two profiles and switch over when you’re playing with an audience. You can create a new profile from the Profiles screen by either cloning your exising one (from the Edit dropdown menu), or clicking Add “Beat Saber” Profile.\nRemoving or resetting BeatVortex If you want to completely reset BeatVortex so that you can start over from scratch, first uninstall all your currently installed mods from the Mods list. Once you’ve done that (and deployed!) jump to the Profiles screen, and choose Remove from the dropdown menu beside the edit button for the “Beat Saber - Default” profile. This will effectively reset your Vortex so that Beat Saber will reappear as an available, unmanaged game in the Games list.\nTo remove BeatVortex entirely, you should uninstall and remove all your installed mods from the Mods list first. After deploying, you can then remove the Default profile (see above), and finally uninstall the extension itself by clicking over to the Extensions screen. BeatVortex will appear near the end of the list as “Game: Beat Saber”. Click Remove to uninstall BeatVortex.\n Note that Beat Saber will still show up in your Games list since Vortex can redownload the extension from Nexus Mods.\n Purging to default If you want to take your game back to a default, unmodded state, you can use Vortex’s Purge feature. Click the Purge Mods button from the Mods list and Vortex will undeploy all your enabled mods, leaving your game directory essentially unmodded.\n You should be prompted to revert BSIPA patching when you purge, and prompted to rerun patching when you next deploy mods.\n Preview Features We sometimes include early previews of new features for BeatVortex that might not be fully ready for primetime. These features are usually functional, but are also usually still in active development and not necessarily as polished as you might expect. You can enable any of these features to get early access to new functionality, but be warned that you will probably see bugs and problems.\nTo check and enable preview features, open the Interface tab of your Settings page and scroll down to find the “BeatVortex Preview Features” section.\nCategories When you first start managing Beat Saber (or after the update to v0.4.x for existing users), BeatVortex will pull down the current set of categories from BeatMods. The next time you start Vortex, you should be able to sort, filter and group your mods by category so you can just check your Stream Tools or hide the Tools for Modders.\nHandling your Mods list Since everything gets installed as a mod when you’re using BeatVortex, your Mods list can get quite lengthy quite fast! Here’s a few tips for keeping your mods list more manageable:\n One of the best options is to group your mods list by source. This will let you look at your BeatMods mods, BeatSaver maps, ModelSaber models, and BeastSaber playlists as convenient groups. Click the small list icon beside the Source column to enable grouping. Remember you can easily add or remove columns from the mod list using the small cog in the top right. You can remove builtin columns (like endorsement) and even add in Beat Saber-specific columns (like artist name or map difficulties). Double clicking any mod will bring up the details pane for that mod. You can use this to edit any missing information, or just to add your own notes about a particular mod or map.

It’s responsible for actually loading all the mods you install with Vortex and needs to be installed for other mods to work correctly.\nSome of the features that BSIPA provides overlap a bit with Vortex and BeatVortex’s feature sets, so it’s worth knowing a few things first.\nGame Upgrade Detection aka Mod Yeeting Plugin Yeeting refers to a feature in BSIPA intended to simplify game ugprades. When BSIPA detects that the game itself has been updated since BSIPA last ran, it will move all your installed plugins into a special folder in your install directory to ensure that incompatible mods aren’t loaded after an upgrade. This process is called “yeeting”.\nWhile this isn’t a problem if you’re manually installing mods (or presumably using Mod Assistant), when BSIPA does this Vortex will lose track of the files it deployed to the install directory and think you deleted them. If BSIPA does “yeet” your mods, you’ll see a dialog in Vortex asking you whether you really want to delete all the files in your mod folders (no, you don’t).\nBeatVortex will now also detect when Beat Saber has been upgraded and offer to disable all your currently installed mods (except for BSIPA) until you can run your game (thus updating BSIPA) and you can then re-enable your mods once you’ve verified they are compatible with the latest game version.\n You can also disable BSIPA’s handling completely using the toggle in the Workarounds tab of your Settings, but we don’t recommend it.\n Plugin/mod Updates Also, by default, BSIPA will auto-update your mods when you launch the game. While this won’t bother Mod Assistant, this means that the mods in your install directory won’t be the same ones Vortex put there. This means a) your in-game mods might not be the same versions you have installed with Vortex and b) Vortex might ask you to save/revert changes made by BSIPA when you next deploy.\nLike with OneClick installs, things will go a lot smoother if you have only one app handling updates, so we recommend disabling updates in BSIPA or in BeatVortex depending on which one you want handling updates.\nWhen you launch Beat Saber from Vortex, we automatically disable BeatMods’s automatic updates, but this will only apply when launching from Vortex by default (see below).\nConfiguration Tweaks  This feature is available in v0.4.0 or later\n Since these overlapping areas can sometimes cause problems, BeatVortex includes the ability to apply overrides/tweaks to the BSIPA configuration file when you deploy your mods. Check the Workarounds tab of the Settings page to find them. Enabling these tweaks will change how BSIPA works when you launch the game.\nDisabling plugin yeeting is the equivalent of setting YeetMods value of the configuration file to false, disabling BSIPA’s plugin yeeting entirely. We don’t recommend using this unless you are running into problems as BeatVortex’s own game update detection should help you through the upgrade process without getting in BSIPA’s way.\nDisabling plugin auto-updates will set the Updates.AutoCheckUpdates and Updates.AutoUpdate values of the configuration file to false, disabling BSIPA’s automatic plugin updates entirely. We recommend turning this on if you’re using Vortex to handle your BeatMods plugin updates as it will mean that your installed version is the version you see in-game, and BSIPA won’t update mods that you haven’t updated in Vortex.\nConfiguration File By default, enabling the tweaks above will only affect Beat Saber when launched from Vortex, not from Steam or anywhere else. If you want the same behaviour when launching from Steam or your Start menu as you get when launching from Vortex, Vortex can also apply these tweaks to your Beat Saber IPA.json. If you enable the Apply these settings to the BSIPA configuration file tweak in your Workarounds tab, Vortex will automatically apply any of your chosen BSIPA changes to your configuration file next time you deploy, ensuring the behaviour is the same, whether you launch from Vortex or not.\n","categories":"","description":"How to manage, configure and work with BSIPA.\n","excerpt":"How to manage, configure and work with BSIPA.\n","ref":"/docs/usage/bsipa/","tags":"","title":"Beat Saber IPA (BSIPA)"},{"body":" BeatVortex 0.3.1 or later is required to install playlists using Vortex.\nIf you’re currently using Beatlist for playlists, see below for extra information.\n Playlist support in BeatVortex is very new and very experimental! The notion of playlists isn’t something that easily maps into the Vortex way of handling things so there might be some rough patches.\nCreating Playlists  This feature is available in v0.3.3 or later\n You can now create your own playlists from the maps you already have installed! Just select multiple BeatSaver maps from your Mods list (hold Ctrl and click) and select Create Playlists from the bar at the bottom of the screen. You’ll be prompted to name your playlist and optionally give it an image. BeatVortex will then create a playlist based on those maps and let you save it to a local file. You can also immediately install it so you can deploy and manage like your other playlists.\nEnabling Playlist Installation To enable installing playlists with Vortex, check the “Enable OneClick links for playlists” option in the Download tab of the Settings page. When you click a OneClick link for a playlist, it should be automatically downloaded and installed into Vortex and will give you the option of immediately installing all the maps from that playlist.\n This can take a while for large playlists! Check the Downloads page to see your progress.\n Playlists will have their own entry in your Mods list so you can edit or remove the playlist without affecting all the songs in the playlist.\nPreview Feature: Playlists view We have also included a very early release of a basic Playlists management interface as a preview feature in the latest extension versions.\nTo enable it, head over to the Interface tab of the Settings page and look for “BeatVortex Preview Features”. Check “Enable Playlists Management” on to enable the new interface, and you should see the new page appear in the sidebar.\n Sometimes you’ll need to open your Mods list again to have it show up!\n This will allow you to quickly list and inspect the playlists you have installed and deployed locally, as well as check the details of any songs included in the playlist. You can also use the button at the top right to immediately install the whole playlist (or just the maps you don’t already have).\nThis feature is very new and there’s certain to be some bugs. If you do enable the feature and encounter any bugs, please report them on GitHub.\nBeatlist Users If you’re currently using Beatlist for managing your playlists, I strongly recommend sticking with it! BeatVortex will likely never support the same features as Beatlist, nor have the same level of polish or user-friendliness.\nIf you do want to use Vortex to manage your playlists, just be aware that enabling playlist handling in your Vortex settings will stop Beatlist from automatically handling playlist install links (it will also prevent Mod Assistant from handling them). You should be able to continue using Beatlist to view and manage your playlist library, but this has not been tested (at all!) and might lead to some weirdness.\nMod Assistant Users If you’re currently using Mod Assistant to install your playlists, you should also be aware of a few things:\n Enabling playlist link handling in your Vortex settings will likely prevent Mod Assistant from handling those links. Installing a playlist with Vortex will separately install each song in the playlist as a manageable mod in Vortex.

If you’re already using BeatSyncConsole, I would not recommend switching to BeatVortex unless you have a solid reason to. BeatSyncConsole is much more configurable, includes support for a multitude of different sources, and is widely used by the community. At this time, there are no plans to extend BeatVortex Sync with more sources or configuration as BeatSyncConsole is perfectly capable of handling that use case.\nIf you’re not currently using BeatSyncConsole, or are looking for a simpler way of syncing bookmarks without needing an external tool, give BeatVortex’s Sync a try. BeatVortex Sync gives you a simpler option, integrated with the rest of your mod management, available through a graphical interface, but without any of the advanced features or configuration of BeatSyncConsole.\nIn short, pick the best tool for your use case! That being said, do not use both at the same time.

Also remember that we are limited to features that Vortex can reasonably support. Open an issue on GitHub to discuss viability of any requests.\nA note on confusing code For anyone who decides to wade into the BeatVortex code, there’s a few things worth remembering:\n I’m not a developer: This is just something I’m doing in my spare time, so don’t expect super-high-quality code. I’ll happily take fixes, though! Working with Vortex is weird: There’s quite a few quirks of the codebase that exist because of unfathomably mystifying behaviour in Vortex’s extension API. There are definitely missing edge cases: This started out as a basic prototype, so error handling and edge cases are definitely not at the standard we’d like. We can’t change BeatMods: More generally speaking, stuff like BeatMods, BeatSaver, BeastSaber and ModelSaber are important resources that we’re just consuming. Also, yeah, BeatMods does weird shit.

If you’re happy with Mod Assistant and don’t have any preference for using Vortex, don’t feel like you need to make the switch!\nThis document assumes a basic understanding of Vortex and its concepts.\nFor help with Vortex, check out the Vortex Support page or use the Knowledge Base page inside Vortex.\n Basic Differences One of the biggest differences when modding Beat Saber with Vortex is a consequence of how Vortex works: everything is a mod.\nThat means that when using BeatVortex, every map is a mod, every custom saber is a mod, every playlist is a mod, and every plugin is a mod. While that sounds daunting, it also means you can easily manage every part of your installation from the one place.\nIn particular, even songs installed using OneClick links will install as a fully manageable mod in Vortex that can be enabled, disabled and deployed to your install directory like any other mod.\nState and Deployments The other thing worth remembering if you’re coming from Mod Assistant is that everything you do in Vortex happens in a staging folder first. Your mods and maps are all installed and enabled from your staging folder. It’s not until you Deploy your mods that the changes happen in your installation directory.\nFor example, when Mod Assistant starts up it loads your current mods directly from the installation directory each time. In Vortex, your Mods list is the state of your staging folder and your changes are made to the installation directory when you deploy your mods.\nOneClick Installation We have added preview support for OneClick installation links for maps, custom models and playlists, but this is a quite new feature! They are also not enabled by default: you can enable OneClick links for any specific mod type (or all of them) from the Download tab of your Vortex settings.\nUnlike Mod Assistant, which doesn’t “track” maps or playlists installed with OneClick links, Vortex will handle OneClick links like any other installation: the map/model/mod is installed as a complete mod, manageable from your Mods list and then deployed to your install directory.\nBSIPA Mod Assistant installs mods into a special IPA/Pending folder and BSIPA then “installs” them into the main game directory. Vortex installs its files into the mod staging folder, then deploys them directly into the game install folder. This means that while you can install new mods or updates into your Vortex while Beat Saber is running you shouldn’t deploy them.\n In fact, if you launched Beat Saber with Vortex, it will pause deployments until you close the game.\n Compatibility While I don’t recommend it, it should be possible to use BeatVortex alongside Mod Assistant, BeatList or any other modding tools. This is not something I actively test and Vortex will likely react in funny ways to changes made by the other tools, but it shouldn’t break anything major.\n If you do end up using BeatVortex side-by-side with Mod Assistant or other tools, please report any issues you see.\n Of particular note: only enable OneClick links in one tool. If you want to use Mod Assistant to install maps with OneClick, enable it in Mod Assistant’s settings and do not enable it in Vortex’s settings.\nSupport As covered in the FAQ, BeatVortex is not supported by any of Nexus Mods, the Vortex team, or the Beat Saber Modding Group. BeatVortex is exclusively a community project, currently run by one not-a-real-developer, so please don’t complain to anyone from Nexus or BSMG if things don’t work quite right.\n","categories":"","description":"A guide on using BeatVortex (and Vortex) for regular Mod Assistant users.\n","excerpt":"A guide on using BeatVortex (and Vortex) for regular Mod Assistant …","ref":"/docs/usage/mod-assistant/","tags":"","title":"BeatVortex for Mod Assistant Users"},{"body":"In general, if your mod is compatible with Mod Assistant, it will work with BeatVortex! See below for some extra information on how different mod types are handled.\nSong Maps BeatVortex includes special logic for installing song maps. As long as your mod archive includes any .dat or .egg files, the installer will automatically extract the archive into its own directory under the Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels directory.\nIf your map is being downloaded from BeatSaver using either OneClick or the ZIP archive, BeatVortex will try and fetch metadata for the map during installation. Once installed, the map will have its source set to “BeatSaver” and metadata should be available in the details panel.\nFor maximum compatibility, don’t nest map files under Beat Saber_Data inside the ZIP file. It should still install correctly, but Vortex will think your map is actually a plugin and might not handle things exactly right.\n Do not change the mod type for installed maps, or they will be deployed to the wrong place.\n Models (Avatars, Sabers and Notes) BeatVortex will pick up that a mod is installing a model based on two conditions: theres only one file and it ends with .avatar, .platform or .saber. As long as those are true, BeatVortex will automatically install the model to its appropriate Custom folder in the Data directory.\nIf the model has been downloaded from ModelSaber, BeatVortex will try and fetch metadata for the model during installation. Once installed, the model will have its source set to “ModelSaber” and some basic metadata should be available in the details panel.\nPlugin Mods Mods that don’t get picked up as either a song map or custom model (see above) will be assumed to be plugin mods. These mods are automatically installed to the root of the installation directory.\nIf a mod has been downloaded from BeatMods, BeatVortex will try and fetch metadata for the mod during installation. This is also true for installs using OneClick (assuming the user has enabled Vortex to handle OneClick links). During installation, BeatVortex will try and pull all the metadata it can from BeatMods including all the basic information, mod version and dependencies.\nType Detection At present, BeatVortex’s methods of detecting what mod types are in use is pretty barebones:\n Mod types are determined by presence of specific files/paths. Maps have .dat|.egg, models have .saber|.platform|.avatar, etc Mod sources are determined by matching the format of the name of the archive. It’s horrible and hacky, but works for now.

Installation logic was completely rebuilt in 0.3.0 (and again in 0.3.1).\n BeatVortex’s installation logic is slightly over-engineered in order to meet a few design goals:\n Handle different mod types invisibly Abstract away the actual download source of a mod Handle both installation and metadata in a Vortex-friendly way.  Background As of 0.3.1, BeatVortex registers three separate installers to handle each of the available mod types: BeatMods-style plugin mods, song maps (from BeatSaver or not), models (from ModelSaber or not). The plugin mod installer also serves as a fallback installer. Vortex is responsible for selecting the installer to use based on basic test conditions (isSongMod and isModelMod in particular).\nOne of the biggest conceptual changes is differentiating the mod type and the mod source. The mod type will control how BeatVortex creates install instructions, and varies for plugins, maps, models or generic files. The mod source will control how BeatVortex provides metadata about the mod and varies for the supported sources: BeatMods, BeatSaver/BeastSaber, and ModelSaber.\nThe ModInstaller interface is used by an installer implementation for a mod type and controls how install instructions are created from a given file list. The MetadataSource interface is a separate optional abstraction that can be used for a mod source to handle any install-time metadata, by returning attribute instructions to be combined with the original install instructions.\nFuture Refactoring This new system is a major rework and definitely not guaranteed stable. As it stands, BeatVortex still has a lot of touch points between Vortex, the extension, the installers and the metadata sources. Future releases will likely tweak the existing ModInstaller/MetadataSource layers to make things a little clearer and handle failures better. Raise a GitHub issue before doing any drastic work around mod installation.\n","categories":"","description":"A deep dive into how BeatVortex handles the actual mod installation.\n","excerpt":"A deep dive into how BeatVortex handles the actual mod installation.\n","ref":"/docs/developer/installers/","tags":"","title":"Installer Logic"},{"body":" The information below only applies to BeatVortex versions from 0.3 onwards. Installation logic was completely rebuilt in 0.3.0.\nAdditionally, dependencies are an area of very active development and things are changing rapidly. Docs may be a little slow to update.\n Dependency management in Vortex is always a bit of a mess and it’s especially so if you’re not using Nexus Mods, which we are definitely not. As it stands, BeatVortex can notify you about missing dependencies and will attempt to install them for you when you install a mod.\n It’s our understanding that BeatVortex is the only game extension handling non-Nexus dependencies so this is uncharted ground.\n There’s some limitations in how Vortex/modmeta-db/BeatVortex/BeatMods interact that makes this story surprisingly hard.\nBeatMods doesn’t have MD5s for archives The backing logic for Vortex’s dependency management happens inside the modmeta-db library. This library allows for querying metadata (including dependencies) using a single identifying key for a mod download: the MD5 sum of the archive. Unfortunately, BeatMods does not store the hash of archive files, only of the individual files. This means we can’t do on-demand lookups (through modmeta-db) for mod files.\nBeatMods does dependencies weird The BeatMods API, for reasons likely lost to time, returns dependencies from the API in a super-weird way: top-level dependencies are fine, but their dependencies are only returned as document IDs, meaning we can’t easily go from a single API call to a full dependency tree. Thankfully, Vortex (mostly) has our back here, and can do basic-but-good-enough dependency resolution.\nVortex doesn’t fully implement modmeta-db The backing modmeta-db supports looking up mod files by a couple of different “keys”: MD5 hash (see above), logical file name, and custom file expressions. At present, since Nexus uses MD5 hashes, Vortex mostly just uses the MD5 hash for installation. In earlier versions of Vortex, that meant we could specify dependency rules, but Vortex wouldn’t know where to find those dependencies.\nVortex releases from 1.2.12 added support for looking up mod dependencies using a logical file name, meaning we can now use a metaserver (essentially an implementation of modmeta-db over REST) to return information on dependencies, including where to find them (i.e BeatMods). Finally, Vortex releases from 1.12.3 onwards improved dependency resolution so that BeatMods extensions installed from archives or the browser should automatically install all the required dependencies.\n A huge thanks to the Nexus/Vortex team, who have been very helpful in expanding and explaining Vortex’s dependency support. Thanks Tannin!\n We now add a metaserver at startup that returns metadata and dependency information for all the mods available on BeatMods. This behaviour can be toggled off in the Settings if desired. With the metaserver disabled, Vortex will still warn on missing immediate dependencies, but it won’t be able to automatically install them, or build a full dependency tree.\nBeatMods provides only basic dependency information BeatMods dependencies can essentially be summarised down to a mod name and specific version. In practice, this is generally enough and mod managers (whether it’s BeatVortex or Mod Assistant) can just install that version. The only problem here is that we are now locking depenencies to very specific package versions which Vortex now has to take a hard-and-fast restriction.\nAs a middle ground, BeatVortex assumes that mod authors are following Semantic Versioning (SemVer) correctly and matches major versions only. That means that, for example, a mod asking for SongCore 2.7.5 could have SongCore 2.9.x installed.\n We’re using the ^ operator for those already familiar with the Node/npm semver format.\n ","categories":"","description":"A deep dive into how BeatVortex handles mod dependencies.\n","excerpt":"A deep dive into how BeatVortex handles mod dependencies.\n","ref":"/docs/developer/dependencies/","tags":"","title":"Dependency Management"},{"body":" The information below is not necessary for just using Vortex to handle your mods. It is included below for transparency and for the interest of curious users.\n There’s a few extra moving parts needed in BeatVortex since we don’t use Nexus Mods for hosting mods. The most important one of these is what Vortex calls a “meta server”. The extension automatically adds a special meta server to your Vortex configuration when it starts up.\nMeta Servers Metaservers are essentially a thin API used to retrieve mod-related metadata for a given file. That’s an important distinction: metaservers are not used to find or download mods, they’re used to get more information about a mod that the client already knows about.\nThe API for metaservers is part of the Nexus-Mods/modmeta-db library, but the one used in BeatVortex has its own implementation\nExample: Dependencies When you install a mod with BeatVortex (let’s use ScoreSaber as an example), the extension will read information from BeatMods to determine its dependencies. Our extension (and therefore Vortex) now know that ScoreSaber needs a certain version of SongCore and BeatSaberMarkupLanguage. What it doesn’t know is where to find them. Vortex then calls its configured meta servers to find out more information about “SongCore” and “BeatSaberMarkupLanguage”, and our server responds with all the information it can pull from BeatMods including the most important part: where to get those files.\nBeatVortex Metaserver So with the background out of the way, what does this have to do with BeatVortex? Well, since we don’t use Nexus, we depend on a metaserver for a lot of the metadata used during mod installation. Notably, we also rely on a metaserver for full dependency resolution (see above).\n BeatVortex still works just fine without the metaserver, but at reduced functionality. For example, Vortex will detect and warn about missing dependencies, but it can’t automatically install them without the metaserver.\n So, to save every user having to run their own server (or running one locally out-of-process), we add a shared metaserver (meta-beatvortex) at startup. This metaserver gets queried by Vortex whenever a user installs a mod. We actually ignore the “default” query that Vortex uses, since BeatMods doesn’t support it. If the server receives a query for a specific dependency though, the server will query the BeatMods API for a matching mod and return some basic info on the mod to Vortex.\nFAQ What information does the metaserver get? The BeatVortex metaserver in particular responds to two queries: by_key and by_name. The by_key query is a single MD5 hash of a file currently being installed. We ignore these, since BeatMods doesn’t support them. The by_name query is a simple API call with two parts: a name (like SongCore) and a version (like ^2.9.1). The server won’t see any other details from your installation or settings.\nCan I run my own metaserver? Yes! The code our server uses is open source on GitHub and easy enough to run on your own. Just run the server, add the BeatVortex plugin, then add its publicly accessible URL to your Vortex configuration.\nCan the metaserver be turned off? Yes, but you probably shouldn’t. Unless you’re testing your own server or something, it’s best to leave it enabled. Disabling the metaserver will immediately remove the server from Vortex’s configuration meaning anything that depends on a metaserver will stop working. Most notably, dependencies won’t automatically be downloaded/installed anymore!\n There was also a bug in Vortex versions prior to 1.12.3 where disabling metaservers didn’t actually remove them which could cause problems during install.\n ","categories":"","description":"How BeatVortex handles mod metadata and some extra features.\n","excerpt":"How BeatVortex handles mod metadata and some extra features.\n","ref":"/docs/developer/meta/","tags":"","title":"Metadata and Meta Servers"},{"body":" The information below only applies to BeatVortex versions from 0.3.1 onwards. Versions prior to 0.3.1 did not include the code necessary to support translations.\n Vortex includes built-in translation support and there’s already quite a few translations available on Nexus Mods. Any of the “common” interface elements from Vortex that are used in BeatVortex (things like menus, tables and common buttons) will all use the language you specify in Settings (under Interface).\n For general information on translation support in Vortex, check out the Vortex wiki\n However, there’s quite a few Beat Saber-specific parts that we add to Vortex, and these won’t automatically be translated. Of particular note are the BeatMods browser, Beat Saber-specific settings and some dialogs and notifications. We’ve built support for translating these elements but that requires actual, you know, translations!\nBuilding Translations If you’re already familiar with Vortex (or react-i18next-based) translations then the short version is that BeatVortex uses a separate beatvortex namespace (and beatvortex.json file) to get localised strings.\n We haven’t worked with Vortex translations much before: please raise an issue if something doesn’t look right or needs changing!\n More specifically, Vortex will usually look for a beatvortex.json file inside %APPDATA%/Vortex/resources/locales/\u003cISO-CODE\u003e and use any translated strings it finds there, falling back to English if none is found.\nExisting Translations If you are working on, or maintaining, an existing Vortex translation, you can add BeatVortex support by adding a beatvortex.json file to your translation package for the BeatVortex-specific strings. A loose example file that should cover most elements is available at beatvortex.dev/beatvortex_en.json that translators can use for a good starting point.\nTranslation However, we’ve added an extra convention to make translations a bit easier: the extension contains a file called language_en.json with all the currently translateable English strings. When Vortex starts up, BeatVortex will load in any language_\u003ccode\u003e.json files it finds, so you can create a language_fr.json file to add French translations or a language_ru.json file to add Russian translations.\nOnce installed, these files will be at %APPDATA%/Vortex/plugins/game-beatsaber/. You can manually create these files while translating.\n To be clear, please try and contribute translations back to the many existing Vortex translations primarily. If there isn’t an existing translation or you’re having trouble getting translations included, only then add them directly to the extension instead.\n Documentation This documentation, like the extension code, is all open-source.

BeatVortex is now made up of almost 4000 lines of code and is one of the more complex Vortex extensions around today. As such, adding new features and fixes can be quite a complex affair.\nFor that reason, I want to be clear about a change I’m making around updates: going forward, each major version of BeatVortex will only be supported on the current Vortex version when it’s released or later. For example, when I released 0.3.1, Vortex was up to 1.2.13, so BeatVortex 0.3.x would support any version of Vortex from 1.2.13 onwards.\nThis is mostly important for upcoming releases: BeatVortex 0.4.x will only be supported on Vortex 1.3 or later. I’ll do my best to make sure newer versions still run with older Vortex versions, but I can’t provide support or guarantee there won’t be problems. If you have automatic Vortex updates enabled, or update regularly, this shouldn’t really affect you!\nAs always, if you have problems, questions or feedback, feel free to leave a comment or raise an issue. If you’re curious, I’ve included a bit more detail on this decision below.\n There’s two major things that control what Vortex versions BeatVortex can support: features and fixes. The simple one is features: if BeatVortex wants to use a new feature or API only included in newer releases, then we need to require that version of Vortex. For example, that was the case for resolving dependencies, some installation features and the upcoming features in 1.3.x. The burden here is that newer versions of BeatVortex might be installed in Vortex versions that don’t include those features.\nFixes is the much more complicated one, but also usually the “harder” limit of the two. In the process of building BeatVortex, I’ve found a number of bugs and inconsistencies in Vortex that the team has been great about fixing. While some of them are pretty minor (like this or this), a few of the bugs we’ve picked up have been fatal for some or all of BeatVortex. Issues in things like mod types, dependency resolution, and mod updates can be pretty much fatal and can be harder to handle. For example, anyone using Vortex \u003c1.2.17 would get an error every time they checked for updates and someone using Vortex \u003c1.2.12 would get warning about conflicts even where there weren’t any.\nIf you’re curious where this whole change came from, it was an upcoming feature in 1.3: dynamic tool parameters. The Vortex team added one of my requested features so we can pass arguments to BSIPA dynamically.

This has barely been tested, and we’re in uncharted territory, so only enable this one if you’re truly brave. Enable them from the Settings page then click Check for Updates in your Mods list to check for updates from BeatMods   Session caching: we’ve started integrating caching support for BeatMods and BeatSaver.  This should pretty dramatically cut down the load on those services by caching requests for the current session.   Create your own playlists: You can now select any number of BeatSaver-installed maps from your Mods list and create a playlist from them  You can save your playlist file locally, or immediately install it into your game (or both!)   Automatic game upgrade detection  BeatVortex will now detect when Beat Saber has been updated since the last time you ran the game (with BSIPA installed) and offer to disable your mods You can then check for updates and re-enable mods once you know they’re compatible.   Extra warnings and detections: BeatVortex will now try and warn you about some common mistakes/errors, such as when mods are going to be yeeted, when you have conflicting update setups, or when installing the wrong files. BSIPA Config Tweaks: check the new BSIPA docs page to learn more. Playlist Management improvements  There’s been a lot of behind-the-scenes updates to the Playlists manager that should make it snappier and stabler. We’ve also fixed the pretty huge bug where the map list would be for the wrong playlist.    As with v0.3.1, this release requires the features and fixes from recent Vortex updates and we strongly recommend only using this version of the extension with Vortex 1.2.17 or higher.\nA note to Mod Assistant users In the pre-alpha release, Mod Assistant and BeatVortex had no real overlap so there was no compatibility concerns. With the new OneClick supportpreview, we finally have our first real compatibility point: who gets launched when you open a OneClick link. Ideally, BeatVortex should not pick up OneClick links until you specifically turn it on in your settings and restart Vortex. Likewise, once you’ve turned it on, Vortex should replace Mod Assistant to handle these links.\nIf you’re encountering problems with OneClick installs, I’d recommend turning off the OneClick support from whichever application you don’t want handling your installs. This is still in preview so if you encounter problems, please open an issue on GitHub with as much detail as you can.\nUpdating mods for fun and profit Beat Saber is now the first game to support Vortex’s mod updates from anywhere other than Nexus Mods! We’ve been working with the Vortex/Nexus Mods team to test out this functionality (and iron out the kinks), but it’s now possible to use Vortex’s built-in updates tools without using Nexus Mods.\n","categories":"","description":"Alpha release of BeatVortex\n","excerpt":"Alpha release of BeatVortex\n","ref":"/blog/2020/06/22/alpha-3.3-release/","tags":"","title":"Alpha 3.3 Release"},{"body":" This release is now available on Nexus Mods.\n This release adds some new features and fixes to the previous alpha release including:\n Optional custom attributes for the Mods list: enable them from the cog in the top right.  The Mods list can now display map difficulties, map modes and artist names for BeatSaver maps, right in the table. Since this depends on new changes (below), these will only appear on maps installed after this update, or you can reinstall the map to get them now.   New custom icons for difficulties and modes: please report any issues you see with these, especially with custom themes. Extended installation metadata: installing mods/maps from BeatMods and BeatSaver will now preserve more metadata under the hood. OneClick links will now auto-install custom maps: you only need to Enable new maps to add them to your install. Improvements to playlist support: installing playlists and maps should be more reliable now. Major code cleanup and refactoring: it might not be a sexy new feature, but this release cleared up a lot of convoluted and obsoleted code, so fixes and features should be a little easier now.

If you can install and test this extension, all feedback (on Nexus Mods or GitHub) is very appreciated!\nThis release adds some big new features and fixes to the previous alpha release including:\n Dependency tracking! Vortex will now warn you about missing dependencies when you install BeatMods mods, and offer to install them automatically. Playlist support: BeatVortex can now install playlists, including from OneClick links, and install maps from an installed playlist. Integrated OneClick Settings: settings to enable/disable OneClick link handling have been moved into the Settings page, on the Download tab. Automatic BSIPA unpatching: Vortex will now prompt you to revert BSIPA when you purge mods to restore things to default properly. Support for translations! Check the translation docs to see how you can help translate BeatVortex into your language. New preview feature: Playlists interface for managing installed playlists. Enable it from the Interface settings. New reworked installation logic to cut down on errors and improve metadata.  A few of the changes introduced in this release including dependencies, metaserver integration and custom mod types require some new features and fixes included in Vortex 1.2.12 and 1.2.13. As such, we strongly recommend only using this version of the extension with Vortex 1.2.13 or higher.\nDependencies As covered in the developer docs, dependencies is a trickier problem than you’d think. As of 0.3.1, Vortex will warn you about missing dependencies and let you check dependencies for individual packages. It will also automatically attempt to download and install the required dependencies when you install a new mod. However, this requires Vortex 1.2.13 or later.\nWhat happened to 0.3.0? There was briefly a 0.3.0 release, but it wasn’t in a state I liked so we skipped straight to 0.3.1 with some more big changes folded in.\nA note to Mod Assistant users In the pre-alpha release, Mod Assistant and BeatVortex had no real overlap so there was no compatibility concerns.

For those interested, this bug was caused by BeatVortex detecting the song files included in a mod and assuming that the archive was a map to be deployed to CustomLevels. This meant that any mod that included both plugin files and map files would fail since the installer would try and deploy them to the wrong location.\nMods that contain map files packaged for the installation root (i.e. Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels/) will now be picked up as mods, rather than song maps, and be deployed correctly.
