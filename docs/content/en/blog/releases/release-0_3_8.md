This is a general bugfix and polish release for the [0.3.x release](/updates/).

This includes fixes for a number of bugs and sources of instability:

- BeatMods browser should be significantly more stable
  - This includes fixes for some bugs on clean installs and general state bugs. Thanks @Pickysaurus!
  - Dramatically improved how we handle version compatibility including support for matching game versions to compatible mod versions
- Improved game version detection that should be more consistent across the extension.
- A few other minor bugs squashed and general performance improvements in a few places.
- We've also changed the icons for playlist-related UI components (creating playlists and the playlist manager) to a new custom one that should be a bit clearer.

For the major updates in this release train, please check the [docs for the previous feature release](/updates/v0.3.3).

### A note on bugs

This release is fixing yet more bugs in the 0.3.x tree, but should also be improving overall polish. If you do find more bugs, *please* reach out on GitHub or Discord and I will do my best to get things fixed as quick as I can.
