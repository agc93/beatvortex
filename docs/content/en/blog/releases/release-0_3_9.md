This is a general bugfix and polish release for the [0.3.x release](/updates/).

This includes fixes for a number of bugs and some minor improvements:

- Beat Saber-specific attributes should now only show when you're managing your Beat Saber mods. Thanks @Pickysaurus!
- Fixed a potential bug that would prevent deployments on new installs.
- Tweaked some attributes for installed mods
- Some more minor fixes, refactoring and cleanup

For the major updates in this release tree, please check the [docs for the previous feature release](/updates/v0.3.3).

## Looking forward

Barring any huge problems, this will be the last of the 0.3.x releases, and I'll be pushing for a 0.4 release in the next few weeks (time permitting). While it won't pack quite the feature list that 0.3.1 did, 0.4.x should still be a good milestone. Thanks to everyone who has reported bugs, helped out with questions, or has just downloaded and used BeatVortex!
