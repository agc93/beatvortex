This is another bugfix release for the [0.3.x release](/updates/).

This includes fixes for two reported bugs:

- Installation failed for mod archives not available on BeatMods
  - Thanks to @Swipperr for [reporting this issue](https://github.com/agc93/beatvortex/issues/5)!
- Installation failed for BeatMods mods with special characters in the name (i.e. Counters+)
  - Thanks to @zmallll for reporting this and Tannin for passing it along!

For the major updates in this release, please check the [docs for the previous feature release](/updates/v0.3.3).

### A note on bugs

This release is fixing yet more bugs in the 0.3.x tree, but should also be improving overall polish. If you do find more bugs, *please* reach out on GitHub or Discord and I will do my best to get things fixed as quick as I can.

Big thanks (as always) to Pickysaurus, Tannin and Nagev for helping out with these bugs and being great about the whole thing.
