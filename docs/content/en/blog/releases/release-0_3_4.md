This release is outdated, and should not be used! There is [a bugfix update](/updates/v0.3.5) for this release available.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

This is a minor bugfix release for the [previous alpha release](/updates/v0.3.3) for the Vortex 1.2.17 release.

The only included fix is to disable a warning about installing loose plugin files (i.e. `dll` files not in an archive). Vortex handles these files correctly from 1.2.17 onwards, so you should now only see this warning if you are using an older version for some reason.

For the major updates in this release, please check the [docs for the previous release](/updates/v0.3.3).
