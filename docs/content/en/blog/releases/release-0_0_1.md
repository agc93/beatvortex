This release is the first pre-alpha of the BeatVortex extension. While you can install this release into Vortex, be aware that it's functionality is *very* limited in this version. 

Mods will be installed and deployed, but install behaviour is not well-defined and you may encounter some unhandled issues. Additionally, this release only supports installing mods from archives and does not support mod metadata. These will be added in future releases.
