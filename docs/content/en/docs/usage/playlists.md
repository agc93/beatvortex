BeatVortex 0.3.1 or later is required to install playlists using Vortex.

If you're currently using Beatlist for playlists, see below for extra information.

Playlist support in BeatVortex is very new and very experimental! The notion of playlists isn't something that easily maps into the Vortex way of handling things so there might be some rough patches.


## Beatlist

If you're currently using Beatlist for managing your playlists, I *strongly* recommend sticking with it! BeatVortex will likely never support the same features as Beatlist, nor have the same level of polish or user-friendliness.

If you do want to use Vortex to manage your playlists, just be aware that enabling playlist handling in your Vortex profile will stop Beatlist from automatically handling playlist install links (it will also prevent Mod Assistant from handling them).. You **should** be able to continue using Beatlist to view and manage your playlist library, but this has not been tested (at all!) and might lead to some weirdness.

## ModAssistant

If you're currently using Mod Assistant to install your playlists, you should be aware of a few things:

- Enabling playlist link handling in your Vortex profile will likely prevent Mod Assistant from handling those links
- Installing a playlist with Vortex will separately install each song in the playlist as a manageable mod in Vortex. Your mod list could get very long, very fast.
