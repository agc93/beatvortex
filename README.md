[Check out the full docs.](https://beatvortex.dev)

## What is it?

BeatVortex is a Vortex extension that adds support for Beat Saber mods so that you can install game mods and custom songs using the Vortex mod manager.

Using BeatVortex, you can install, manage, track and uninstall mods for Beat Saber just like you install mod archives for any of the other Vortex-supported games. Note that this comes with a few limitations:

- No one-click Nexus installs (Nexus Mods doesn't host Beat Saber content)

## What isn't it?

First and foremost, this isn't a replacement for any of the other amazing modding tools available for Beat Saber on PC (in particular, Mod Assistant). This project exists only as a simpler way of installing and managing mods for players who are already familiar with Vortex usage.

## How to use it?

There's a heap of documentation, including detailed guides on getting started with BeatVortex, in our [online docs](https://beatvortex.dev/docs/). Essentially, you'll just need to install an extension for Vortex, then you're ready to start installing and managing your mods.
