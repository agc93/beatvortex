&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/96?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release adds some new features and fixes to the &lt;a href="../updates/v0.3.1">previous alpha release&lt;/a> including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Optional custom attributes for the Mods list: enable them from the cog in the top right.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Mods list can now display map difficulties, map modes and artist names for BeatSaver maps, right in the table.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Since this depends on new changes (below), these will only appear on maps installed after this update, or you can reinstall the map to get them now.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New custom icons for difficulties and modes: please report any issues you see with these, especially with custom themes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extended installation metadata: installing mods/maps from BeatMods and BeatSaver will now preserve more metadata under the hood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OneClick links will now auto-install custom maps: you only need to Enable new maps to add them to your install.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improvements to playlist support: installing playlists and maps should be more reliable now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Major code cleanup and refactoring: it might not be a sexy new feature, but this release cleared up a lot of convoluted and obsoleted code, so fixes and features should be a little easier now.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As with &lt;a href="../updates/v0.3.1">v0.3.1&lt;/a>, this release requires the features and fixes from recent Vortex updates and we &lt;strong>strongly&lt;/strong> recommend only using this version of the extension with Vortex 1.2.13 &lt;em>or higher&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-note-to-mod-assistant-users">A note to Mod Assistant users&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the pre-alpha release, Mod Assistant and BeatVortex had no real overlap so there was no compatibility concerns. With the new OneClick support&lt;sup>preview&lt;/sup>, we finally have our first real compatibility point: who gets launched when you open a OneClick link. Ideally, BeatVortex should not pick up OneClick links until you specifically turn it on in your settings and restart Vortex. Likewise, once you've turned it on, Vortex &lt;strong>should&lt;/strong> &lt;em>replace&lt;/em> Mod Assistant to handle these links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're encountering problems with OneClick installs, I'd recommend turning off the OneClick support from whichever application you don't want handling your installs. This is still in preview so if you encounter problems, please open an issue on GitHub with as much detail as you can.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Alpha 3 Release</title><link>/blog/2020/06/02/alpha-3-release/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/06/02/alpha-3-release/</guid><description>
&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/96?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release marks the next full alpha of the BeatVortex extension. If you can install and test this extension, all feedback (on Nexus Mods or GitHub) is very appreciated!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release adds some big new features and fixes to the previous alpha release including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Dependency tracking! Vortex will now warn you about missing dependencies when you install BeatMods mods, and offer to install them automatically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Playlist support: BeatVortex can now install playlists, including from OneClick links, and install maps from an installed playlist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integrated OneClick Settings: settings to enable/disable OneClick link handling have been moved into the Settings page, on the Download tab.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic BSIPA &lt;strong>un&lt;/strong>patching: Vortex will now prompt you to revert BSIPA when you purge mods to restore things to default properly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support for translations! Check the &lt;a href="../docs/developer/translation">translation docs&lt;/a> to see how you can help translate BeatVortex into your language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New preview feature: Playlists interface for managing installed playlists. Enable it from the Interface settings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New reworked installation logic to cut down on errors and improve metadata.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A few of the changes introduced in this release including dependencies, metaserver integration and custom mod types require some new features and fixes included in Vortex 1.2.12 and 1.2.13. As such, we &lt;strong>strongly&lt;/strong> recommend only using this version of the extension with Vortex 1.2.13 &lt;em>or higher&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As covered in the &lt;a href="../docs/developer/dependencies">developer docs&lt;/a>, dependencies is a trickier problem than you'd think. As of 0.3.1, Vortex will warn you about missing dependencies and let you check dependencies for individual packages. It will also automatically attempt to download and install the required dependencies when you install a new mod. However, this &lt;strong>requires Vortex 1.2.13 or later&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-happened-to-030">What happened to 0.3.0?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There was briefly a 0.3.0 release, but it wasn't in a state I liked so we skipped straight to 0.3.1 with some more big changes folded in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-note-to-mod-assistant-users">A note to Mod Assistant users&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the pre-alpha release, Mod Assistant and BeatVortex had no real overlap so there was no compatibility concerns. With the new OneClick support&lt;sup>preview&lt;/sup>, we finally have our first real compatibility point: who gets launched when you open a OneClick link. Ideally, BeatVortex should not pick up OneClick links until you specifically turn it on in your settings and restart Vortex.

&lt;p>If you're encountering problems with OneClick installs, I'd recommend turning off the OneClick support from whichever application you don't want handling your installs. This is still in preview so if you encounter problems, please open an issue on GitHub with as much detail as you can.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Alpha 2.3 Release</title><link>/blog/2020/04/20/alpha-2.3-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/04/20/alpha-2.3-release/</guid><description>
&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/96?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release adds some new features and fixes to the previous alpha release including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixes bug when installing &amp;ldquo;combined&amp;rdquo; mods (see below)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adds search filtering to the BeatMods browser.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="combined-mods">&amp;ldquo;Combined&amp;rdquo; mods&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There was a bug in versions prior to 0.2.2 that would cause some mods (SongCore, for example) to fail during installation. For those interested, this bug was caused by BeatVortex detecting the song files included in a mod and assuming that the archive was a map to be deployed to &lt;code>CustomLevels&lt;/code>. This meant that any mod that included &lt;em>both&lt;/em> plugin files and map files would fail since the installer would try and deploy them to the wrong location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mods that contain map files packaged for the installation root (i.e. &lt;code>Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels/&lt;/code>) will now be picked up as mods, rather than song maps, and be deployed correctly. Make sure you don't change the mod type for these mods as this will almost certainly break deployment.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">
&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/96?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a bugfix and feature release hotfix for the &lt;a href="../blog/2020/04/17/alpha-2.1-release/">previous alpha release&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This hotfix corrects the following bugs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The extension would attempt to register assets before loading had finished
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This &lt;em>should&lt;/em> silently fail in Vortex 1.1.x, but 1.2 will throw an error.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Huge thanks to @Pickysaurus for spotting and reporting this bug!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Alpha 2.1 Release</title><link>/blog/2020/04/17/alpha-2.1-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/04/17/alpha-2.1-release/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This release adds a ton of missing features from the initial pre-alpha including:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Improved handling of game mods to improve deployments&lt;/li>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is the first pre-alpha of the BeatVortex extension. While you can install this release into Vortex, be aware that it's functionality is &lt;em>very&lt;/em> limited in this version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mods will be installed and deployed, but install behaviour is not well-defined and you may encounter some unhandled issues. Additionally, this release only supports installing mods from archives and does not support mod metadata. These will be added in future releases.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
