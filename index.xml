&lt;p>This release is now available &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/96?tab=files">on Nexus Mods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release adds some new features and fixes to the previous alpha release including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixes bug when installing &amp;ldquo;combined&amp;rdquo; mods (see below)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adds search filtering to the BeatMods browser.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="combined-mods">&amp;ldquo;Combined&amp;rdquo; mods&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There was a bug in versions prior to 0.2.2 that would cause some mods (SongCore, for example) to fail during installation. For those interested, this bug was caused by BeatVortex detecting the song files included in a mod and assuming that the archive was a map to be deployed to &lt;code>CustomLevels&lt;/code>. This meant that any mod that included &lt;em>both&lt;/em> plugin files and map files would fail since the installer would try and deploy them to the wrong location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mods that contain map files packaged for the installation root (i.e. &lt;code>Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels/&lt;/code>) will now be picked up as mods, rather than song maps, and be deployed correctly. Make sure you don't change the mod type for these mods as this will almost certainly break deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-note-to-mod-assistant-users">A note to Mod Assistant users&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the pre-alpha release, Mod Assistant and BeatVortex had no real overlap so there was no compatibility concerns. With the new OneClick support&lt;sup>preview&lt;/sup>, we finally have our first real compatibility point: who gets launched when you open a OneClick link. Ideally, BeatVortex should not pick up OneClick links until you specifically turn it on in your profile and restart Vortex. Likewise, once you've turned it on, Vortex &lt;strong>should&lt;/strong> &lt;em>replace&lt;/em> Mod Assistant to handle these links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're encountering problems with OneClick installs, I'd recommend turning off the OneClick support from whichever application you don't want handling your installs. This is still in preview so if you encounter problems, please open an issue on GitHub with as much detail as you can.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Alpha 2.2 Release</title><link>/blog/2020/04/19/alpha-2.2-release/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/04/19/alpha-2.2-release/</guid><description>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is a bugfix and feature release hotfix for the &lt;a href="./blog/2020/04/17/alpha-2.1-release/">previous alpha release&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This hotfix corrects the following bugs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The extension would attempt to register assets before loading had finished
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This &lt;em>should&lt;/em> silently fail in Vortex 1.1.x, but 1.2 will throw an error.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Huge thanks to @Pickysaurus for spotting and reporting this bug!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Alpha 2.1 Release</title><link>/blog/2020/04/17/alpha-2.1-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/04/17/alpha-2.1-release/</guid><description>

&lt;li>Improved handling of game mods to improve deployments&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Configurable profile features&lt;sup>preview&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved metadata handling including covers for maps, where available&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Major under-the-hood refactorings that should improve performance and cut down on errors&lt;/li>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This release is the first pre-alpha of the BeatVortex extension. While you can install this release into Vortex, be aware that it's functionality is &lt;em>very&lt;/em> limited in this version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mods will be installed and deployed, but install behaviour is not well-defined and you may encounter some unhandled issues. Additionally, this release only supports installing mods from archives and does not support mod metadata. These will be added in future releases.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
